		<line>After the communications fiasco, things returned to a much more calm state on the bridge.  The Captain begins to think again.</line>
		<line>"I know that the terraforming of Mars is a big deal, but do they really need what we're carrying?"</line>
		<line>He ponders that thought for a moment longer but the ideas in his head are interrupted by the wailing of the alarm again.</line>
		<line>"What is it this time!"  he barks to the crew.</line>
